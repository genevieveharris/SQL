The following project utilizes data from a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

--Who were the top 3 purchased artists in Germany in 2010?

SELECT artists.name, customers.country, invoices.invoicedate, SUM(invoice_items.Quantity) AS tracks_sold
FROM artists
LEFT JOIN albums
ON artists.artistid=albums.artistid
LEFT JOIN tracks
ON albums.albumid=tracks.albumid
LEFT JOIN invoice_items
ON tracks.trackid=invoice_items.trackid
LEFT JOIN invoices
ON invoice_items.invoiceid=invoices.invoiceid
LEFT JOIN customers
ON invoices.customerid=customers.customerid
WHERE customers.country LIKE 'Germany'
AND invoices.invoicedate LIKE '2010%'
GROUP BY artists.name
ORDER BY tracks_sold DESC
LIMIT 3; 

--List how many sales each genre had in 2011 and 2012.

SELECT genres.name, SUM(invoice_items.Quantity) AS tracks_sold
FROM genres
LEFT JOIN tracks
ON genres.genreid=tracks.genreid
LEFT JOIN invoice_items
ON tracks.trackid=invoice_items.trackid
LEFT JOIN invoices
ON invoice_items.invoiceid=invoices.invoiceid
WHERE invoices.invoicedate LIKE '2011%'
OR  invoices.invoicedate LIKE '2012%'
GROUP BY genres.name
ORDER BY genres.name;
